# Artwork App

In this project, I have created a personalized digital art space app that displays an array of artwork that I can showcase. Unlike following step-by-step instructions, I built the app independently with limited guidance, using the concepts that I learned so far.

I used Jetpack Compose with Kotlin to design the app UI and applied the necessary state management to handle the user interactions.

## Prerequisites
- Experience with *Kotlin syntax*, which includes *Boolean* and when *expressions*.
- Ability to apply basic *Jetpack Compose* concepts, such as the use of state with MutableState object.
- Experience with composable functions, which includes Text, Image, and Button composables.
- How to build *low-fidelity prototypes* and translate them to code.
- How to build simple layouts with *Row* and *Column composables*, and arrange them with *horizontalAlignment* and verticalArrangement* parameters.
- How to identify states and modify them upon triggers, such as button taps.

## What I've Learned
- Adding an Image composable to an Android app using Compose.
- Implementing behavior for an Image composable in an Android app with Compose.
- Opening and modifying the Composable code of an Android app.
